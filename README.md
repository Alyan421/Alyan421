#  Hi, I’m Muhammad Alyan  

I’m a **Software Developer** focused on **backend systems, SQL-driven applications, and data-centric problem solving**, with growing hands-on experience in **machine learning and deep learning**. I enjoy building scalable, practical solutions that turn raw data into meaningful insights through clean APIs, optimized databases, and intelligent models.

I’ve worked on **full-stack applications** using **.NET Core, Angular/React, PostgreSQL, and Azure**, with experience in:
- Designing RESTful APIs  
- Building reporting & analytics modules  
- Optimizing queries and data models for performance  
- Applying **deep learning models** to real-world datasets  

I’m currently deepening my expertise in **data engineering, analytics, cloud-based systems, and deep learning**, and actively building real-world, impactful projects in these areas.
